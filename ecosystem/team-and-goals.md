# Team & Goals

## When was Kintsugi.Finance launched?

Kintsugi [went live on October 6, 2022](https://medium.com/kintsugifinance/) Our first set of vaults opened on that same day.

Kintugi is forked from beefy’s battle tested code that have not been affected by any exploits. However, interacting with smart contracts is always a risk. The Kintsugi team and its associated projects are not liable for any loss of funds due to smart contract exploitation, hacks, user error or any other reason.
Projects listed on Kintsugi Finance are provided at protocol request. Please DYOR before investing in any third party vault.

## How is Kintsugi Farm Organized?

Kintsugi Finance is a decentralized working hub for people with a vision to come together and build the future of global finance. Smart contract devs, UI, UX, strategists, statisticians, designers, and artists - anyone can join and contribute (no matter your nationality, sex, or views). By investing in Kintsugi Finance, you are investing in the idea that a group of highly technical individuals can safely, securely and creatively leapfrog the dinosaurs of traditional finance.


## DeFi, anonymity and Kintsugi

Personalities get in the way of projects, and we believe Kintsugi speaks for itself. By having a team that operates anonymously, even amongst itself, we can focus on providing the best experience for our users. That’s because we believe the strength of Kintsugi comes from what we build, which is an opportunity for investors to both automate and maximize the return of investment of their holdings. We urge anyone with concerns that anonymity diminishes credibility to join our Discord community and get a first-hand feeling for the strength and depth of the project.

## How can I get in touch with Kintsugi?

Our global community managers and team members can be contacted anytime through our official [Telegram](https://t.me/kintsugifinance) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/yq8wfHd) channels. We should mention that generally speaking within investment communities there are some bad actors around looking to scam, phish, or maliciously target users. Please double check the validity of whoever you talk to, and remember that no one representing Kintsugi will ever ask you to provide wallet keys or recovery codes.
