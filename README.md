## What is Kintsugi Finance?

Kintsugi is a Decentralized, Yield Optimizer built on Arbitrum that allows its users to earn compound interest on their crypto holdings. Kintsugi earns you the highest APYs with safety and efficiency in mind.

Through a set of investment strategies secured and enforced by smart contracts, Kintsugi automatically maximizes the user rewards from various liquidity pools (LPs),‌ ‌automated market making (AMM) projects,‌ ‌and‌ ‌other yield‌ farming ‌opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem.

Kintsugi is forked from the battle tested smart contracts of Kintsugi Finance and our core focus is aggregating yield from newer dexes/protocol on the Arbitrum network while also adopting the Beefy SAFU practices.

The main product offered by Kintsugi Finance are the Vaults in which you stake your crypto tokens. The investment strategy tied to the Vault will automatically increase your deposited token amount by compounding arbitrary yield farm reward tokens back into your initially deposited asset. Despite the name Vault suggests, your funds are never locked in any Vault on Kintsugi: you can always withdraw at any moment in time.

DeFi applications are unique in the sense that they are permissionless and trustless, meaning that anyone with a supported wallet can interact with them without the need for a trusted middleman. While you have funds staked in a vault, you remain 100% in control of your crypto.

## What is TSU?

TSU is the multiutility token of Kintsugi. The utility is twofold: TSU stakers earn a part of the revenue generated by Kintsugi, and both holders and stakers are entitled to vote on important governance decisions.

Platform revenue is generated from a small percentage of all the vault profits and distributed back to those who stake TSU.

The revenue sharing mechanics entail you can stake TSU to either earn more TSU in a TSU Native Vault, or earn blue chips like ETH, BNB, FTM, MATIC, AVAX, and more in the TSU Earnings Pools.

The supply of TSU is limited at 200,000 tokens and available on SushiSwap
